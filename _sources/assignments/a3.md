Assignment 3: Team Project
==========================

## Assignment Introduction

By now you should have some basic familiarity with the other members of your group. Charting out the quarter likely revealed some details about the types of classes your teammates are enrolled in and at least of a few of their broader interests in life. This is a great start, but only one small part of cultivating a healthy team dynamic. Typically, when a new project starts a team is going to need to identify its strengths and weaknesses. But before you are ready to journey down that path, you need to spend some time establishing trust. While the Communication Covenant is useful for holding team members accountable, the trust that the your covenant is built on must emerge through the bonds that you make with one another. So for this assignment, you will first work on building trust, then take the first steps to developing your project for the quarter.

## Assignment Details

A great way to build trust is through social (non-work) interaction. Rather than dive into a stressful task, making time to get to know one another in a casual context will help establish a bond within your team that you can build upon for the rest of the quarter. So the first thing you will do for this assignment is make plans to do something social. It doesn't matter what you do. Meet up between classes and throw a frisbee, get lunch, or just sit at a table and chat about your goals for the year. Your only requirement is that you choose to do something genuine. In other words, don't simply meet before class and take a selfie!

### Part 1: Group Photo

For the first part of this assignment, all that is required is that you create visual evidence of your social activity. Make a video or take a photo of the event. Make sure everyone is present in the photo.

### Part 2: Project Description

Once you have had a chance to get to know each other socially, it's time to get to work. You might want to meet again (or add this part onto the end of your social activity) or use your preferred communication tool to start to plan out your project for the quarter. For this part of the assignment you will create a 1-2 paragraph project description.

Your project description is NOT a business case (you will write a complete business case for assignment 4), rather it is a clear and concise explanation of the project your team will pursue this quarter. You are not expected to know everything yet, so don't get hung up on specific details like implementation, features, requirements, etc.

## Submitting 

Once you have completed both parts 1 and 2, submit a link to your Google doc to the Assignment 3 page on Canvas.

Ensure that **all** course staff have been added as members of your group directory **and** have edit permissions on your documents.
