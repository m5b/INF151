Assignment 6: Project Gantt Chart
=================================

## Assignment Introduction

The Gantt chart can be a powerful task management and visualization tool for controlling complex projects. The flexibility of the Gantt format makes it useful for practically any type of project. This assignment will provide you with the opportunity to formalize your project plan and work breakdown while learning about assembling and managing a Gantt chart. 


## Assignment Details

The source of input for you project Gantt chart should be the WBS document you created for A5. If you need a refresh on how a Gantt chart is assembled review the course text and the overview discussed in lecture.

The exact way you develop your Gantt will depend on the data captured in your WBS. Since each team's WBS is going to be different, there are far less rules about __how__ to go about populating your chart. The following rubric will be used to grade your submission, so use it to guide your gantt development.


### Assignment Rubric

2 point
: Correct use of identifiers (e.g., tasks, milestones)

2 point
: Correct us of the timeline (e.g., dates, time estimates, dependencies)

1 point
: Readability, clarity, correct formatting

1 point

### Part 2: Preparing your Gantt Chart

You should use the [Ganntt Google Sheet template from Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/content/google-sheets-project-management-templates#gantt-chart-template) that we previously discussed in lecture to create your chart. It's a bit tedious to fill out, but give the scope of your project, should not be too overwhelming to manage.

As a group, create a new document in your group's **`stage`** directory and name it **`TEAMNAME-assignment-6-project_ganttchart`**. Take a screenshot or two of your Gantt Chart and add it to the beginning of the document along with a direct link to your Ganntt Sheet. Some of your charts might be quite lengthy, so do your best to ensure that the chart is readable in picture format. If you have to zoom in and divide the image into multiple pictures, then do so. Just ensure that a third party (your instructors) can read it without having to zoom in and out! 

## Submitting 

Once you have completed both parts 1 and 2, submit a link to your Google doc to the Assignment 6 page on Canvas.

Ensure that **all** course staff have been added as members of your group directory **and** have edit permissions on your documents.
