Week 2 already? 

This week you continue setting up your Gantt chart, finalizing your project description and roles, and securing your work for the quarter. If you haven't already, take a look at [Assignments 2](../assignments/a2.md) and [3](../assignments/a3.md). They are _both_ due this Friday, so plan on finding some time to meet with your group over the next three days to wrap these assignments.

## Announcements

* If you still do not have a group to work with _please come see me asap!_
* In-class quizzes will start next week (Week 3)! So be sure to read the assigned materials so you are prepared.
* Readings for this week can be found on Canvas using the link below. However, Schwalbe chapters 4 and beyond will require individual access to the course text. I will no longer be providing PDF's.

## Todos

* Finish A2 and A3 (due Friday)
* Start reading Schwable chapters 2 & 3
