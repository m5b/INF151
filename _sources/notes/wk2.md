Week 2 already? 

This week you will be wrapping up your Gantt chart assignment and finalizing your team project description. If you haven't already, take a look at [Assignment 3](../assignments/a3.md). It is due this Thursday, so plan on finding some time to meet with your group over the next two days.


## Announcements

* I realize that some of the groups are getting kind of messy...we will reorg as needed on Thursday. If you are in a 3-person group, plan on either merging with another small group or disbanding to join a new group.

## Todos

* Finish A2 (due Tuesday) and A3 (due Thursday)
* Start reading Schwable chapters 2 & 3
